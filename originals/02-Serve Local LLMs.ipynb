       "Geopolitics is a constantly evolving landscape, so there are many complex and interconnected issues at play.  Here's a breakdown of some prominent ones:\n",
       "\n",
       "**1. The Russia-Ukraine War:** This ongoing conflict has significant global consequences, impacting energy markets, food security, and international relations. \n",
       "\n",
       "   * **Humanitarian Crisis:** Millions displaced, cities devastated, and lives lost. International aid is vital to address the immediate needs.\n",
       "   * **Geopolitical Shift:** Reshaping alliances, prompting greater scrutiny of Russia's power, and potentially triggering a \"new cold war.\"\n",
       "   * **Economic Impact:** Global supply chains disrupted, energy price volatility, and potential for recession.\n",
       "\n",
       "**2. China-U.S. Relations:** A complex relationship marked by economic interdependence, competition in trade, technology, and global leadership. \n",
       "\n",
       "   * **Trade War:** Ongoing tension over tariffs, intellectual property, and trade barriers impacting both economies.\n",
       "   * **Technology Competition:** Control of AI, semiconductors, and space exploration are critical factors shaping future alliances.\n",
       "   * **Taiwan Strait:** A major flashpoint in the Asia-Pacific region; China's assertive stance towards Taiwan threatens regional stability.\n",
       "\n",
       "**3. Climate Change & Environmental Policies:** Global warming is impacting countries differently, leading to climate migration, resource conflicts, and geopolitical tensions around climate finance and enforcement. \n",
       "\n",
       "   * **International Agreements:**  The Paris Agreement aims for global cooperation on emissions reduction; however, implementation varies widely.\n",
       "   * **Resource Wars:** Competition over water and other resources intensified by population growth, climate change, and political disputes.\n",
       "   * **Geo-Economic Implications:** Shifting economic powers, new trade alliances, and investment in renewable energy sources are key factors driving this dynamic.\n",
       "\n",
       "**4. Energy Security & Geopolitical Control of Resources:** The global reliance on fossil fuels (especially oil and gas) is shifting as renewable energy sources become more prevalent. \n",
       "\n",
       "   * **Resource Conflicts:** Competition for resources like lithium, cobalt, and rare earth elements needed for electric vehicles and battery technology.\n",
       "   * **Geo-Economic Influence:** Countries with abundant resources or strategic control over them can exert significant influence on global trade and politics.\n",
       "   * **Energy Diplomacy:** Shifting energy alliances, new pipelines, and international cooperation to diversify energy sources are key priorities for many nations.\n",
       "\n",
       "**5. Rising Nationalism & Populism:** A resurgence of nationalist sentiment across the globe is leading to increased tensions between countries, questioning established norms, and contributing to political instability.\n",
       "\n",
       "   * **Protectionist Policies:** Increased tariffs on imports and trade barriers limit global economic cooperation.\n",
       "   * **Political Polarization:** Political rhetoric emphasizing national identity and cultural division often fuels conflict and undermines international dialogue.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "**Beyond these major issues, other geopolitical concerns include:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Cybersecurity threats:** Growing concern over cyber warfare and the potential for disruption of critical infrastructure.\n",
       "* **Nuclear proliferation:** Continued tension surrounding nuclear weapons development and security, particularly in North Korea and Iran.\n",
       "* **Migration and refugee crises:** Large-scale displacement due to conflict, climate change, and poverty continues to drive international cooperation challenges. \n",
       "\n",
       "It's important to note that these are just a few examples of the many complex geo-political issues facing the world today. Their interconnections make them challenging, but also offer opportunities for collaboration and global solutions.  \n",

    "### Model customization\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows three different ways the new model is customized:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setting `temperature` which affects the degree of randomness.  The range is `(0.0, 1.0)`, where lower is described as *\"more coherent\"* and higher is described as *\"more creative\"*.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Setting `num_ctx` which is the context window size, measured in *tokens*.  This is a critical parameter for performance & memory consumption.  The default in Ollama for local models is 2048 tokens.  In general a bigger window will result in higher quality output but will increase processing time and RAM consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Few Shot Learning (FSL) using a short set of example interaction messages between `user` prompts and `assistant` responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE1:** What is a *token*?  This is dependent upon the model architecture for how inputs are tokenized, however a rule-of-thumb is that a token represents about 4 Bytes or 4 characters of input text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE2:** What is a *context window*?  It represents how much \"memory\" the model has to work with, though it is important to consider *Signal-to-Noise* effects of \"too much\" data in memory.  Within an LLM interaction session the total context will grow, up to the maximum context window size, when context then becomes FIFO.\n",
